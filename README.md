The initial step of the project was to create an HTML file with the necessary elements for displaying current weather condition. This included a user search input, temperature of areas and weather conditions such as wind speed and humidity. 
Secondly was the page’s design using a CSS file to present a user-friendly appearance. Styling the input bar, search button, and card display to appear appealing. Using a linear-gradient display between a teal green and midnight purple, it presented a weather app pallet in correlation with the sky’s coloration.
Afterwards I obtained data from OpenWeatherMap source by requesting an API key. This allowed me to obtain weather and forecast information I can display by using a fetch process to call the endpoints and user input. From then it sent requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and processed the response to display in the necessary field. I created functions in a JavaScript file to call the data from the API and use constants to change it to the proper format.
To display accordingly, I updated the HTML content with the fetched weather data to present it on the site.
